    <h2>Informer - Skateboarding Basics</h2>
    <p>Skateboarding has increased considerably in the past few years as a major
      sport among America's youth. Although the equipment involved in
      skateboarding is fairly straightforward, there is still some degree of
      education involved for newcomers to the sport. Regardless of what type of
      skateboarding you plan on doing, you will no doubt need theh core
      components of a skateboard, which consist of a
      <a href="#" class="info"
      onclick="return showInfoWindow('skatedeck.html', event)">deck</a>, <a
      href="#" class="info" onclick="return showInfoWindow('skatetrucks.html',
      event)">trucks</a>, and <a href="#" class="info"
      onclick="return showInfoWindow('skatewheels.html', event)">wheels</a>.
      Additionally, it's a good idea to consider a <a href="#"
      class="info" onclick="return showInfoWindow('skatehelmet.html', event)">
      helmet</a> and <a href="#" class="info"
      onclick="return showInfoWindow('skatepads.html', event)">pads</a>,
      especially if you plan on skating any tall obstacles such as vert ramps
      and concrete bowls.
