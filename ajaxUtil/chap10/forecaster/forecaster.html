    <h2>Forecaster - Traveling the U.S.</h2>
    <p>A great way to get the full cultural experience of traveling is to hit
      the road and cover as much terrain as possible. Within the U.S., it is
      possible to experience the full range of climates, which can often make
      planning difficult in terms of preparing for different kinds of weather.
      For example, let's say you start your trip in <a href="#" class="info"
      onclick="return showInfoWindow('forecaster.php?zipCode=10001', event)">
      New York City</a> with the plan of crossing the country and finishing in
      <a href="#" class="info"
      onclick="return showInfoWindow('forecaster.php?zipCode=94129', event)">
      San Francisco</a>. Depending upon the time of year, you will experience
      quite a variety of different weather. If your trip cuts deep into the
      south, you'll come to understand why <a href="#" class="info"
      onclick="return showInfoWindow('forecaster.php?zipCode=30301', event)">
      Atlanta</a> is affectionately known as Hotlanta. Cruising west, you'll
      need to keep your eyes peeled for tornadoes as you pass through
      <a href="#" class="info"
      onclick="return showInfoWindow('forecaster.php?zipCode=73101', event)">
      Oklahoma City</a>. If you thought Atlanta was hot, your stop off in
      <a href="#" class="info"
      onclick="return showInfoWindow('forecaster.php?zipCode=85003', event)">
      Phoenix</a> will quickly let you know why they call it the Valley of
      the Sun. Traveling northward to get a break from the heat, a stop off
      in <a href="#" class="info"
      onclick="return showInfoWindow('forecaster.php?zipCode=80012', event)">
      Denver</a> at the foot of the Rockies is sure to energize you for the
      final push toward California.
